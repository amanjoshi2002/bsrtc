## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB server

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanjoshi2002/bsrtc.git
   cd bsrtc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster-url>`, and `<dbname>` with your MongoDB credentials.
   - Replace `your_jwt_secret` with a secure secret key for JWT authentication.

4. **Connect to MongoDB:**

   Ensure your MongoDB URI is correct and that your MongoDB server is running. If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your IP is whitelisted and credentials are correct.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 5000).

2. **Access the API:**
